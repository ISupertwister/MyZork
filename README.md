# MyZork
My prototype Zork project. 

Here is MyZork! There were some difficult points while developing the project. But at the same time, doing this project taught me a lot, and I had a lot of fun doing the project. I hope you enjoy reviewing the project and I can get a positive result from your evaluation. Thank you very much for your interest.

I developed the project through Visual Studio 2019. After the project was completed, I uploaded it to GitHub. The reason for this is that I have no previous experience with GitHub. It took me a while to understand and learn what to do and how to do it.
