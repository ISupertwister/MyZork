# MyZork
My prototype Zork project. 

Here is MyZork! There were some difficult points while developing the project. This process was incredibly stressful for me because I desperately wanted my application to be accepted. Blood, sweat, and tears. But at the same time, doing this project taught me a lot, and I had a lot of fun while developing MyZork! I hope you enjoy reviewing the project and I can get a positive result from your evaluation. Thank you very much for your interest.

I developed the project through Visual Studio 2019. After the project was completed, I uploaded it to GitHub. The reason for this is that I have no previous experience with GitHub. It took me a while to understand and learn what to do and how to do it.

There are 6 regions in the game: Forest of Falsehoods, Lake of Envisage, Mountain of Illusions, Emerald Plateau, The Grand Hall, and Throne of Ending.

Our character has 5 stats:

Strength(increase your health and damage)

Magic(Normally, I had a plan like this for this stat: Our character is a warrior who is not prone to magic. However, if the player has at least 5 magic with the choices he makes, he will be special in the final boss battle. However, unfortunately, I could not add this feature due to problems in the project and time limit.)

Ability(increase your crit damage)

Composure(increase your crit rate)

Wisdom(If the development process had gone as planned, this stadium would have been useful in various events, but unfortunately I could not do this.)

I even designed an event that we would hold using wisdom:

As you kept walking, you saw a portrait hanging on the wall. You observe a mighty warrior in the portrait. A few words written beneath the portrait have caught your attention. Would you want to examine closer? (Yes or No) (Need 6 wisdom.)
Yes (if wisdom is enough): A warrior, depicted as if made of sheer light, painted in a pose battling fiends. You start reading the note beneath the portrait.

“The greatest knight of all time, Sir Lionel Messi, defies the forces of corruption, and with his own light, he battles the encroaching darkness.”
The portrait has been damaged and torn by the trails of claws. Probably the thing they like the most is not this portrait here. (+1 Composure)

Yes(if wisdom is not enough): ): A warrior, depicted as if made of sheer light, painted in a pose battling fiends. You tried reading the note beneath the portrait, but you fail to do so as you don’t know the language it’s written.

The portrait has been damaged and torn by the trails of claws. Probably the thing they like the most is not this portrait here. 
No: You decide to ignore the portrait and proceed.
